title: Cut function in R without scientific notations

I use cut to group data in R which I later plot with ggplot2.

```R
> data[,km_interval:=cut(maxlevel,seq(0,400000,by=50000))]
```

The output is a vector in scientific notation with my grouped data. This notation seems to be awful for ~~muggles~~ non-scientists so I like to avoid it in my plots.
```R
8 Levels: (0,5e+04] (5e+04,1e+05] (1e+05,1.5e+05] (1.5e+05,2e+05] (2e+05,2.5e+05] (2.5e+05,3e+05] ... (3.5e+05,4e+05]
```
The solution is to use the argument *dig.lab* in cut function. When labels are not given it determines the number of digits used in formatting the break numbers.
```R
> data[,km_interval:=cut(maxlevel,seq(0,800000,by=50000),dig.lab = 6)]
```

```R
8 Levels: (0,50000] (50000,100000] (100000,150000] (150000,200000] (200000,250000] (250000,300000] ... (350000,400000]
```
